                My coding journey didnâ€™t come easily to me like most programmers who have been
                  programming since they were kids my passion came after completing my first project
                   from scratch and seeing a vision of mine come to fusion and function properly. 
                   It was an amazing feeling going from sketching out an idea to coding it. 
                   Took time and alot of effort but it was a very rewarding feeling in the end.
